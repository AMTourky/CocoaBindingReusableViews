# CocoaBindingReusableViews
A sample OS X app showing how to reuse views on an app which uses cocoa binding and core data

A Master details app showing a Manager as master element and Employee as detail elements

## Reusable Inspector views:
Both Managers and Employees are Persons! have first name, last name and date of birth
To Inspect these two models, the inspecting views will have those basic info UI elements duplicated!! 
So, as reusable code is highly prefered, reusable views are as well! and this is an attempt to achieve it.
